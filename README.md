# Adventure-Work-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard-

The objective of this project is to create an end-to-end sales analytic report based on AdventureWorks database. Database sample based on a fictitious multinational bicycle manufacturing company named AdventureWorks.
This database was created by Microsoft.
 
These are the main stages of the project:
 
# 1. Collecting the Data:
AdventureWorks database sample is available to download here.
 
# 2. Creating the Database:
There are two options to create the DB:
Creates the DB on the local computer by running a ruby file to convert CSVâ€™s into a format usable by Postgres, as well as a Postgres script to create the tables, load the data, add primary and foreign keys, and create some of the views used by AdventureWorks.

 
# 3. Data Filtering:
The  data is already cleaned and filtered, but if you want you can filter data asper your requirement.
 
# 4. Data Cleaning:
For data cleaning you can use power query of Excel or Power BI power query.
 
# 5. Data Modeling:
From here Power BI Desktop will be used to complete next stages.
At this point it is required to import the data from excel.
 
# 6. Creating DAX Measures
Building a complete set of DAX measures allows to gain insight from the data and built more complex visualizations.
    
# 7. Creating Visualizations
Exploring different variables and their relationships with each other reveals which visualizations are more appropriate to represent the information obtained from data analytic.
Once the visualizations have been created and selected, it is time to start building the dashboard.
 
# 8. Building the Dashboard
Power BI provides different tools such as bookmarks, buttons, slicing, drill-through, page navigation and other techniques that can give a complete view of the insights found in the DB.
